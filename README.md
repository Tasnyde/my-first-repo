# A little insight into Todd Snyder
Hi All, My name is Todd Snyder and I have been in supply chain and distribution for nearly 20 years. I have managed multiple distribution centers ranging from 150k square foot to a million.

# My Career Passions
I love supply chain distribution. However, I am currently looking to pivot in my career. I no longer want to be tied to a building. I would rather consult and I am hoping as I learn more aboout AI, I hope I can leverage those skill to bring value to organizations looking to improver their supply chains and distribution networks.

# My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is to travel. I have a goal of hitting all 7 continents. I have 2 left to get to and cannot wait to check it off my bucket list.
